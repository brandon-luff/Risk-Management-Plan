# Risk Management Plan

## Objective

The objective of the Risk Management Plan is to identify, assess, and mitigate risks that Health Network Inc., a fictional company, might face, ensuring the organization's data security, operational continuity, and compliance with legal standards such as HIPAA. This plan aims to protect critical business functions and resources from various threats, minimizing potential disruptions and financial impacts.

### Skills Learned

- Risk Assessment and Analysis: Learning how to identify potential threats and assess their impact on business operations.
  
- Strategic Planning: Developing strategies to mitigate or transfer risks, and prioritize actions based on resource availability and severity of risks.
  
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Understanding the critical business functions and resources, and determining the maximum acceptable outage (MOA) and recovery objectives (RPO/RTO).
  
- Crisis Management: Training in the execution of contingency plans and crisis response.

## Steps

### Threat Identification:

- Listed potential threats including ransomware, phishing, social engineering, and physical security flaws.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:

- Developed mitigation plans for each identified threat, such as employee training, enhanced security measures, and using cloud services to handle denial-of-service attacks.
      
### Deployment Strategy:

- Developed a deployment strategy that ensured minimal downtime and seamless transition from the current infrastructure to the new AWS-based solution. This included setting up a parameter store for secure configuration management and deploying necessary resources in multiple availability zones​​​​.

### Resource Allocation:

- Analyzed and allocated necessary resources (time, skills, money, tools) to manage and mitigate risks effectively.

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA):

- Identification of Critical Functions: Identified critical business functions, especially those involving data storage and retrieval.

- Assessment of Critical Resources: Evaluated human, financial, and hardware resources needed to support critical functions.

- Establishment of MOA and Impact: Set parameters for maximum acceptable outage and assessed potential financial impacts.

### Recovery Objectives:

- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Determined the maximum tolerable period in which data might be lost due to a disruption, estimated at 4-6 hours.

- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Set the maximum acceptable downtime for critical functions, aiming for 3-6 hours.

### Implementation of Security Measures:

- Deployed encryption, network security, and regular backups to secure sensitive data.

### Documentation and Review:

- Documented the entire risk management process and established a schedule for regular reviews and updates to the plan.
